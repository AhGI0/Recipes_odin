   <h1>Christmas Wreath Charcuterie Board</h1> 
       <img src="./imgs/Chris.webp" alt="christhmas!">
     <p>This Christmas wreath charcuterie board is a fun board to make for any holiday gathering. I found it easier to make if the board is round, but a square or rectangular board is fine if that is what you have. Add all your favorite charcuterie fixins—just use the photo as your guide—and it will be a hit! All amounts listed for this recipe are approximate.</p>

     <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Arrange ingredients in a circle on a board, using the photo as a guide, and working from the outer edge in. Leave a circular area at the center open.</li>
        <li>Once you are satisfied with the placement of ingredients, line the center circle with rosemary sprigs, and tuck in a few around the outer edge to give it the look of a wreath.</li>
